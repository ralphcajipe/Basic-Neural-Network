Basic classification: Classify images of clothing

This guide trains a neural network model to classify images of clothing, like sneakers and shirts. It's okay if you don't understand all the details; this is a fast-paced overview of a complete TensorFlow program with the details explained as you go.

This guide uses tf.keras, a high-level API to build and train models in TensorFlow.
